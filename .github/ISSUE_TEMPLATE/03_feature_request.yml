        Please tell us the problem you are running into that led to you wanting
        a new feature.

        Is your feature request related to a problem? Please give a clear and
        concise description of what the problem is.

        Describe the alternative solutions you've considered. Is there a workaround
        you're currently using? Are there similar features in other IoT apps
        that solve this problem?
      placeholder: |
        Example: "I'm always frustrated when I need to monitor multiple devices 
        from different locations, but the current app doesn't allow me to group 
        devices by location on the dashboard. I have to scroll through a long 
        list to find the devices I need to check."
    validations:
      required: true
  - type: textarea
    attributes:
      label: Proposal
      description: |
        Briefly but precisely describe what you would like the ThingsBoard  app to be able to do.

        Consider attaching something showing what you are imagining:
         * mockups or wireframes
         * screenshots from other apps
         * videos demonstrating the desired behavior
         * code samples if it's a technical feature

        Please also consider:
        - How would this feature integrate with existing ThingsBoard platform capabilities?
        - Would this feature be useful for other ThingsBoard users in similar IoT scenarios?
        - How would this feature work on both mobile platforms (iOS and Android)?
      placeholder: |
        Example: "Add a 'Device Groups' feature that allows users to:
        1. Create custom groups (e.g., 'Office Floor 1', 'Warehouse Sensors')
        2. Assign devices to multiple groups
        3. View a group-based dashboard with aggregated data
        4. Receive group-level notifications
        
        This could be implemented as a new tab in the main navigation, 
        similar to how the current 'Devices' tab works."
